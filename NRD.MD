No freely public source is reliable enough for NRDs.
These include sources like:
- https://github.com/maaaaz/dnsdumps
- https://github.com/shreshta-labs/newly-registered-domains
- https://github.com/xRuffKez/NRD
- https://github.com/cenk/nrd

The best source is probably https://www.whoisds.com/newly-registered-domains , They provide a small sample of NRD which nowhere to close to the full list, which needs to be purchased.

https://github.com/cenk/nrd & https://github.com/xRuffKez/NRD seem to be sourcing their data from whoisds as well.
Thus, they are what's used for the NRD list, but like stated above, this list is not at all accurate.
